# TripAdvisorSentimentAnalysis-
This is my proposal for a sentiment analysis task to be done on Trip Advisor's review. 
The only task that this challenge proposed was to classify each review as positive or negative. 
The train set is contained in the development.csv file and contains the ground truth labels for the classifier
training. The test set is instead contained in the evaluation.csv file but the ground truth is private since 
it was used to evaluate the competition. 

All the details of my solution is contained in the solution report, the code is also commented.
